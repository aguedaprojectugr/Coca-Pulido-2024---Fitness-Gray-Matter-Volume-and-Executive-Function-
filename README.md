Fitness, Gray Matter Volume, and Executive Function in Cognitively Normal Older Adults: Cross-Sectional Findings From the AGUEDA Trial

ABSTRACT
The aim of the study is to investigate the association of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular strength indicators with
gray matter volume (GMV) and to study whether fitness-related regions of GMV are associated to executive function (EF) in
cognitively normal older adults. Ninety-one cognitively normal older adults (71.69±3.91 years; 57.14% females) participated in
this study from the AGUEDA trial. CRF was measured by a 2-km walking test and a 6-min walking test. Muscular strength was
measured by handgrip, biceps curl, squats, and isokinetic strength tests. T1-weigthed images were obtained through a magnetic
resonance scan. GMV was determined by voxel-based morphometric analysis. Standardized EF tests were performed. CRF did
not show any positive association with GMV. Handgrip strength was positively associated with GMV (p<0.001) in nine regions (β from 0.6 to 0.8 and k from 106 to 1927) and knee extension strength in three regions (β from 0.4 to 0.5 and k from 76 to
2776). Squats strength was negatively associated with GMV (p<0.001) in two regions (β=−0.3, k=1102 and k=152) and the
2-km walking test in one region (β=−0.4, k=99). Only handgrip strength-related GMV was associated with cognitive flexibility
(p=0.039, β=0.215) and spatial working memory (p<0.03, β 0.247–0.317), but not with EF score (p>0.05). Muscular strength,
but no CRF, may be positively related to GMV in cortical and subcortical regions, with implications for specific cognitive domains rather than the overall EF score. Specifically, handgrip strength was the indicator most associated with higher GMV, while
squats strength and CRF were negatively related to GMV.
